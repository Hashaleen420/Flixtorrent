This app lets you watch movies and series. It uses the Torrentio API to fetch torrents and allow you to watch movies and series.
The app needs some work doing to it but for the time being it is working good enough for me.
If you have a real-debrid account then it will be so much better using it as the built in app player will actually work fast. Otherwise if you dont you can download
  Amnis Video Player and watch the torrent file that.
The cast button has some issues but it does cast to the TV. You need to connect to the tv before selecting the file you want to stream, if you are watching 
in the built in app player then it doesnt cast properly to the TV.
