🎬 Flixorent (Android)
A modern, native Android application for streaming movies and TV shows.

Flixorent is a lightweight, "plug-and-play" alternative to complex streaming setups. Built entirely in native Kotlin, it leverages the TMDB API for rich metadata and integrates directly with Torrentio to provide high-quality streams without the need for external add-ons or configuration.

Whether you are a power user with a Debrid account or a free user looking for a solid torrenting experience, Flixtorrent handles it all with a unified, Netflix-style interface.
